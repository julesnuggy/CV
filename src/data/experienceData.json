As well as providing an interface to its standard app-based features, the toolkit provides additional features to support businesses, such as: managing invoices; tracking bills and expenses; and calculating tax.\n* CBILS - developed a customer-facing web app and internal management tools and features to allow small businesses to apply for the “Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme”. Primary benefits of this work include: (1) allowing customers to quickly self-verify if they qualify for a loan; (2) connecting to third-party APIs to simplify application submission and assessment processes; and (3) freeing up time and resources for the business to focus on high-priority, eligible applications.\n* Account Comparison Tool - developed bespoke tools for customers to view and compare a wide variety of UK business bank accounts. I delivered end-to-end features for both the customer-facing web app and the content management system. This tool helps potential customers to make an informed choice on if and how Starling’s business bank account is best suited for their specific needs by improving the research experience against simple product comparison websites."
